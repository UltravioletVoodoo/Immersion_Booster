# Immersion_Booster
A web based Dungeons and Dragons immersion booster. It is currently live [here](https://immersion.jonbezeau.dev/)

## Concept
The app features a 2 tab design with an administrator tab and a viewer tab. The administrator tab is a controler for the viewer tab. Using the administrator tab, users can create representations of D&D campaigns and oneshots by loading images, audio files, notes, etc. These elements can then be displayed on the viewer tab to increase player immersion.
