# Immersion_Booster
A web based Dungeons and Dragons immersion booster

## Concept
- 2 screens: admin/player
- admin contains controls
- player shows results

## Ideas (player-facing)
- NPC face (while roleplaying)
- Dice roller
- Crit fumble / critical hit screens
- Effects
- Monster appearance (outline with low perception or something maybe)
- Turn indicator (shows intiative order too!)

## Ideas (admin-facing)
- Import JSON adventure assets
- Mini version of what is showing on player-facing
- Real-time controls for all the player-facing features
- Link music with events? (combat / location / etc)
